<b>We Guess, You're Thinking- What We Do?</b>
We here provide a platform where a person willing to help is connected to a person who needs help. The process helps those who are in need as well as rewards those who help others with coins which can be used to buy stuff. Thus, it helps both the parties and brings happiness to everyone.
